Single Responsibility Principles - A class should have one and only one reason to change

Open Closed Principles - sw entities should be open to extension but closed for modification.

Liskov's substitution principle - subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. Break the hierarchy & Tell, don't ask.

Interface Segregation Principles - Recommends smaller interfaces to bigger ones. Implementation classes of interfaces should use only the methods that are required, and classes should not be forced to use the methods.

Dependency Inversion Principle  - Code to the abstractions rather to implementations.
